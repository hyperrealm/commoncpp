commonc++ is a C++ class library for developing cross-platform systems
software for POSIX (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X) and Windows (2000/XP)
systems. It provides an intuitive, object-oriented
abstraction/portability layer around common operating system
facilities like threads, concurrency mechanisms, sockets, networking,
shared memory and other IPC mechanisms, regular expressions, files,
streams, logging, process execution, scheduling, and more. It also
includes a collection of common abstractions like strings, buffers,
object pools, a random number generator, timers, and so on. Three
extension libraries also provide simple object persistence built on
Berkeley DB, XML parsing/manipulation built on Expat, and a Java
Native Interface (JNI) wrapper to ease the development of hybrid
C++/Java programs.
